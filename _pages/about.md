This is the front page of Yunhao Zhang's website. In Chinese, "yun"  means cloud and "hao" describes the night sky is going to be illuminated by rising sunlight. Thus I name my homepage as "astrocloud" to show my heart belonging.

I am a senior undergraduate student at Peking University, now at University of California Santa Cruz as a visiting student. My major focus is to understand galaxy formation and evolution so as to have deep insight into fundamental physics of cosmology. My fields of interests include 1) interstellar gas and dust content in distant galaxies; 2) co-evolution between active galactic nucleis and their host galaxies; 3) stellar populations and structures of nearby galaxies in multiple environments. At present, I am still on the way to explore the treasures of sky.
